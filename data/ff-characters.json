Cid has set a transport business at the town of Poft with his airship, using the money charged for the flights to maintain it. During Firion and his allies' quest to destroy the Dreadnought, Cid tells Firion that airships are powered by Sunfire, and that a lack of control of it would cause any engine to explode. After Firion and his friends obtain the Sunfire at Kashuan, Cid and Princess Hilda attempt to meet them there, but Cid's airship is captured by the Dreadnought itself. The rebels succeed in infiltrating the Dreadnought and rescuing both Cid and Princess Hilda and destroy the warship.\r\n\r\nLater, Cid is fatally injured during the onslaught of the Emperor's Cyclone, and is taken to Paul's home in Fynn. After the Cyclone is destroyed, he summons Firion to his bedside and gives him the airship, which Firion uses to enter Palamecia Castle to stop Leon.\r\n\r\nHowever, Cid's soul travels to Machanon with other people who have perished fighting the Empire. Cid joins the fallen white knights of Fynn to aid the perished civilians escape the monster-filled Raqia caverns and set up a small town beyond the passage inside. When Minwu, Scott, Ricard and Josef leave Raqia, they arrive at Machanon as well, and meet Cid, who also offers them advice on their quest.",

In Final Fantasy III, the Cloud of Darkness appears as a green-skinned female humanoid emerging from a portal of darkness at its waist. It has a red heart-shaped mark on its forehead, and several mouthed tentacles around it. In Yoshitaka Amano's concept art of it and in Dissidia Final Fantasy, the Cloud of Darkness takes the form of a shapely woman wearing a red and black cape with the rest of its body covered in red and black markings. It has the red heart-shaped mark on its forehead, and has long silver hair. It has only two tentacles, emerging from its waist. The Cloud of Darkness is the tallest non-giant character in the Dissidia series. Though the Cloud of Darkness universally takes on a feminine form, it is officially considered a genderless being that merely chooses to appear as such. The Cloud of Darkness refers to itself in the plural, using \"We\" instead of \"I\". Dissidia Final Fantasy explains this as its two tentacles having minds of their own, and the humanoid body speaking for the three of them.",

Initially introduced as a antagonist, he has made a number of appearances in remakes and later titles. To date, Gilgamesh has had more appearances in any Final Fantasy media than any other character, and may be the only character to appear in more than one game in the main series (see below). Gilgamesh began a tradition of an incompetent, comical, yet persistent recurring boss for the player to face.\r\n\r\nGilgamesh's role has varied greatly from ally, to enemy, to summon, but for most of his appearances he is a traveling sword collector who battles with a variety of rare and powerful weapons. In most, if not all, of his appearances, Gilgamesh is searching for the legendary sword, Excalibur, but often ends up with the imitation known as Excalipoor. Another of Gilgamesh's trademarks is Genji equipment, which can be stolen from or dropped by him.\r\n\r\nOriginally voiced in Japan by Daisuke Gōri for the Japanese release of Final Fantasy XII before his death on January 17th, 2010, Gilgamesh's voice is provided by Kazuya Nakai as of Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, by Riki Kitazawa in Final Fantasy XIV, by Kazuya Nakai once more in World of Final Fantasy, and by Kazuhiko Inoue in Final Fantasy XV. In the English versions, Gilgamesh is voiced by John DiMaggio in Final Fantasy XII, Keith Szarabajka in Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy Type-0 HD, Kurt Wilson in Final Fantasy XIV and Tom Taylorson in Final Fantasy XV.",

His popularity among Final Fantasy fans, at least outside Japan, as an antagonist is rivaled only by Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII. Kefka is known for his many one-liners, his final almighty appearance (which has become something of a tradition in the series), as well as his sociopathic hatred of everything in existence. Kefka's defining character trait is his laughter, a high-pitched whooping cackle. In large part because of his dark humor and jester attire, Kefka was also given the nickname ''the psycho clown'' by fans, with this eventually becoming official with his CollectaCard description in Theatrhythm Final Fantasy.",

Shinra follow her and Aeris gives herself to the Turks in exchange for Marlene's safety. During this time, Aeris asked Marlene questions regarding Cloud's personality, suggesting she had developed a crush on him.\r\n\r\nMarlene is then left with Elmyra, Aeris's adoptive mother, and is later held hostage by the Shinra spy Cait Sith to force Cloud to cooperate with him on their journey to the Temple of the Ancients. She later receives the news of Aeris's death at Sephiroth's hands by Reeve. Marlene appears one last time at the end of the game, sensing Aeris's presence just before the Lifestream emerges to aid in the conflict between Holy and Meteor.\r\n",

Fans of the series usually refer to it as \"FF\" for short.\r\n\r\nElena's mission is to vanquish all evil in order to bathe the world in light, and has thus been dubbed the \"Warrior of the Crystal.\" She has vowed to show no mercy to those who selfishly make others suffer, and keeps fighting against the wicked with help from the blue crystal fastened to her left arm.\r\n\r\nNot much is known about Elena except for her deeds as the \"Warrior of the Crystal.\" She refers to the crystal fastened to her left arm as her \"partner\" and always addresses it in a very familiar manner. Many fans have come to theorize that the reason behind this is because she received it from someone very special to her.",
